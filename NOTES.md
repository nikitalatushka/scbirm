# Interface vs. Type
The purpose of this file is to enforce a structure on a model.
TypeScript has 2 ways to achieve this: 
    - type
        - use for non-composite properties
        - such as `type Direction = 'up' | 'down' | 'left' | 'right';`
    - interface
        - can be extended from/by classes
        - use when defining properties
